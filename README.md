# Moon Landing using Deep Reinforcement Learning

Here I train a DRL agent using Deep Q-Learning to perform Moon Landing within the OpenAI Gym's environment.  

Train the agent using the script ```train_agent.py``` and test how well the agent performs using the script ```test_agent.py```.  

It uses PyTorch for training the agent. The conda environment can be installed from ```gym.yml``` file as ```conda env create -f gym.yml```.
